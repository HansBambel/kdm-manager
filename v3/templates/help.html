                    <b>How do I report a bug or a problem with the Manager?</b>
                    There are two ways to report issues.<br/>&nbsp;
                    The fastest way is to open the left-side navigation menu, click or tap "Report an Issue or Error" and fill out a short report. This emails the maintainers of the Manager directly and includes information about you and your settlements that makes issues easier to research.<br/>&nbsp;
                    Alternately, if you use GitHub, feel free to open issues in <a href="https://github.com/toconnell/kdm-manager/issues" target="top">the Manager's public repository</a>.

                    <b>How do I add players to a campaign?</b>
                    To add players to a settlement/campaign, open the Survivor
                    Sheet of any survivor, click on "Survivor Administration"
                    and set the email address of the survivor to the email
                    address of the player who you want to use it.<br/>
                    Doing this <i>does not</i> send an email or alert to that
                    person (for security/privacy reasons).<br/>
                    Assuming that the email address belongs to a registered user
                    of the Manager, making them the "owner" of the survivor will
                    allow that player to access your settlement (they will see
                    it on their dashboard) and to manage the survivor and any
                    "public" survivors in your settlement.

                    <b>Why can't I create a new settlement?</b>
                    Non-subscriber users are limited to three (3) settlements. "Abandoned" settlements count towards this total. If you are not a subscriber to the Manager, please <a href="https://thelaborinvain-2.myshopify.com/" target="top">consider purchasing a subscription</a>. Alternately, you may wish to remove one of your existing settlements.<br/>&nbsp;
                    To do this, make sure that you have enabled the "Delete" button (check the "System" panel on the dashboard) and then, from the Settlement Sheet, permanently delete the settlement.

                    <b>Why does my Timeline include Lantern Year 0?</b>
                    All settlement timelines begin with Lantern Year 0. The <a href="http://tools.kingdomdeath.com/faq/" target="top"> offical FAQ</a> confirms that the Prologue takes place during "Lantern Year 0. When the Timeline is updated in the first Settlement Phase it becomes Lantern Year 1."

                    <b>I accidentally selected a principle. How do I remove it?</b>
                    On the Settlement Sheet, just beneath the checkboxes for selecting principles, there is a bold, maroon-colored checkbox next to the words "Unset Principle". Click the maroon checkbox and select the principle you with to remove. The Manager remove the principle and undo any modifications that its selection may have made to your survivors.

                    <b>When I return Departing survivors, does the Manager check if any have the "Tinker" ability?</b>
                    No. For now, the Manager only evaluates whether survivors are alive or dead when returned and uses that information to determine how many Endeavors to add. In the future, this may change, but for now, this is how it works.

                    Settlements created by users who do not subscribe to the Manager are removed after they reach 180 days of age (the settlements, not the users).

                    <b>What is the difference between "New" and "Newborn" survivors?</b>
                    The Manager distinguishes between "new" and "newborn" survivors: survivors created without parents are considered "new", while survivors created <i>with</i> parents are considered "newborn."<br/> &nbsp; Bonuses and effects that apply to "newborn" survivors will be automatically applied to them at "birth" (i.e. creation), but those bonuses will <i>not</i> be applied at creation time to survivors who are merely "new".

                    <b>How do I create survivors with parents?</b>
                    Advance the Timeline to Lantern Year 1 or later. Survivors added to the settlement in LY 0 may not have parents. Such survivors are considered "new" and are not subject to "newborn" benefits inherent to campaign or expansion content.
