    involes an odd name-to-handle conversion method and some un-DRY iteration
    for creating dicts out of names.

    On account of that, it sets attribs for all of the assets in its 'assets'
    dict during initialization and, though it supports normal AssetCollection
    methods, it's not recommended to call most of them (given the general non-
