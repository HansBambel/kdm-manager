## Introduction 
[https://kdm-manager.com](https://kdm-manager.com) or, as it is generally
called, the Manager, is an Interactive campaign manager for *Monster* by
[Kingdom Death](https://kingdomdeath.com).

This repository currently contains the code for the legacy, CGI version of the
web application which does not do much when deployed without the KDM API.
The KDM API lives here:
[https://github.com/theLaborInVain/kdm-manager-api](https://github.com/theLaborInVain/kdm-manager-api)


## Important!
Both the Manager and the API are developed by [The Labor in Vain](https://thelaborinvain.com),
which has no affiliation with Kingdom Death.

**Neither the [https://kdm-manager.com](https://kdm-manager.com) service nor any
of the software utilized by that service (including the API deployed at

authorized, supported by or affiliated with Kingdom Death or Adam Poots Games,
LLC.**
